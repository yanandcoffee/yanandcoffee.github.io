I am a Senior Software Engineer focusing on UI at Adobe. I am someone who cares about the user experience and it is embedded in all of my work. I love React.js, Javascript, and CSS, so most of my blog postings will be on these topics. I'll also post some career related pieces here and there as I learn more in my career. Hope you enjoy the content!
