I'm just going to briefly introduce myself and Coffee here. The logo of this blog is a drawing of my dog, Coffee. This blog was started because I wanted to share my code and experiences w/ others who may find my code and explanations useful, or interesting! Or both! In real life, I am an extroverted introvert; straightforward, sometimes humorous, and highly practical.

I've been coding for about 6+ years professionally. I am someone who cares about the user experience and it is embedded in all of my work. I love React.js, Javascript, and CSS, so most of my blog postings will be on these topics. I'll also post career advice and think pieces. Hope you enjoy the content!
